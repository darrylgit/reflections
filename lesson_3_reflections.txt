--When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository if you wanted yourself or others to be able to access your code from other computers.

--Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Someone else may have written code that conflicts with a feature you're currently working on.

--Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Fork- copying someone else's GitHub repository and putting it on your own profile so you can edit it independently while still leaving a
link to the original repository.
-Clone- copying a repository onto a local computer. Use this to "download" something from GitHub.
-Branch- Sets up a different version of the master code that you can edit independently. Useful for adding experimental features.

--What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can then keep track of what changes you've made since last making a git push.

--How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I'd probably send emails or use a flash drive. I know Gmail doesn't allow you to attach Javascript files, so that'd be
problematic. Also, we wouldn't have access to things like a commit history, pull requests, etc. Keeping track of what
changes had been made to the files would be nigh impossible.
