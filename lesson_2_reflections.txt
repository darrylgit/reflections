--What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you make a repository, it groups all the files in the directory together.
You can then make commits and whatnot.

--How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the intermediate between the working directory and the repository. It gives you a greater control over what you commit.

--How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can use git status to see what files I'm about to commit.

--What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are good for adding and experimenting with a new feature before merging it with the master.

--How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
I can see which branches start where, and which commits are included in each branch. I can also easily see any unreachable commits;
these are commits that 'branch' off but have no branch name associated with them. I couldn't git log a branch name and see that commit.
