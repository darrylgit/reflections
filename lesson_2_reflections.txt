--What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you make a repository, it groups all the files in the directory together.
You can then make commits and whatnot.

--How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the intermediate between the working directory and the repository. It gives you a greater control over what you commit.
